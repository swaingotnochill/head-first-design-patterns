### Strategy Pattern

Hi. Strategy Pattern is the very first pattern I learnt from the book. The core principls
of strategy pattern is:

> 1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and seperate them from what stays the same.
> 2. Program to an interface, than an implementation.
> 3. Favour Composition over inheritance.


Definition: The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one,
and makes them interchangable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients
that use it.

Here, we created a miniDuck Simulator game to understand the Strategy Principle.
